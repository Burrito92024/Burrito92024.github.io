    <p>Ivy's scientific name is Araliaceae. Most often ivy has leaves similar to a maple tree leaf, sporting the five margins or indents in the leaves sides. There are around 15 different species of ivy, with hundreds of varieties within each species. If you were walking though a forest, the ivy that you would likely come across would be English Ivy. English Ivy is very common, its leaves are mostly lobed dull green leaves with distinct light veins running through them, keep in mind that the leaves can be greatly variegated, so the colors are not always identical. Ivy is invasive throughout the Eastern and Western United States.
