    <h1>Philodendrons</h1>
    <p>Philodendrons are tropical plants characterized often by green and sometimes coppery or purple leaves, the leaves vary considerably in texture, size and shape. The stems of a philodendron are always a slightly different color than the leaves,  and their roots are mostly aerial. Some common philodendrons are the Heartleaf, Splitleaf (more commonly know as the Mostera), and the Lemon-Lime Philodendrons. These plants are easy to grow inside and despite how large they can get, they prefer smaller pots.</p>
